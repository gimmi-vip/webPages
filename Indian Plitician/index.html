						<p>In his first year as prime minister, Modi reduced the amount of money spent by the central government on healthcare.[161] The Modi government launched New Health Policy (NHP) in January 2015. The policy did not increase the government's spending on healthcare, instead emphasising the role of private healthcare organisations. This represented a shift away from the policy of the previous Congress government, which had supported programmes to assist public health goals, including reducing child and maternal mortality rates.[229] The National Health Mission, which included public health programmes targeted at these indices received nearly 20%[230][231] less funds in 2015 than in the previous year. 15 national health programmes, including those aimed at controlling tobacco use and supporting healthcare for the elderly, were merged with the National Health Mission. In its budget for the second year after it took office, the Modi government reduced healthcare spending by 15%.[</p>

						<p>As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth ₹6.6 trillion were signed.[78]

		<p>In September 2013 Modi was named the BJP's candidate for prime minister in the 2014 Lok Sabha election.[168][169] Several BJP leaders expressed opposition to Modi's candidature,[170] including BJP founding member L. K. Advani, who cited concern with leaders who were "concerned with their personal agendas".[171] Modi played a dominant role in the BJP's election campaign.[172][173] Several people who voted for the BJP stated that if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate, they would have voted for another party.[168][174][175] The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign.The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi</p>
